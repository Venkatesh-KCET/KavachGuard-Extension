**NSFW Content Classification**

This guide explains how to use Python code to train a computer program to identify different types of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content using a dataset of images. NSFW content includes explicit or adult material. The code uses the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is like a tool that learns to recognize things from pictures.

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Getting Ready:**
   - Connect to Google Drive by running a piece of code. This is where your dataset is stored.

2. **Preparing the Dataset:**
   - The dataset is a bunch of images sorted into four categories: "hentai," "neutral," "pornographic," and "sexy." Each category has its own folder with pictures inside.
   - We'll use these images to teach the program what each type of content looks like.

3. **Making the Pictures Better:**
   - We'll use a trick called "Data Augmentation" to make the pictures more diverse. It's like giving the program more examples to learn from.

4. **Building the Learning Model:**
   - Imagine the MobileNetV2 as a ready-made model that knows about many objects. But we want it to learn about NSFW content.
   - We'll "freeze" the MobileNetV2 so it doesn't forget what it knows.
   - We'll add new layers on top of it to teach it about NSFW content.

5. **Training the Model:**
   - We'll teach the program to recognize NSFW content by showing it the dataset we prepared.
   - The program will learn by comparing its guesses to the right answers (labels) we gave it.
   - We'll do this many times (epochs) to make the program better at guessing.

6. **Seeing the Progress:**
   - We'll create graphs to see how well the program is learning. One graph shows how much the guesses improve, and another shows how accurate the program is becoming.

7. **Saving the Trained Model:**
   - Once the program has learned enough, we'll save its progress into a file. This way, we don't have to teach it all over again next time.

**Using the Jupyter Notebook:**

- In this folder, you'll find a file called "Kavach_img.ipynb." This notebook helps you train the model. You can upload it to Google Colab or use it directly.
- Use the dataset scraped earlier in the "dataset" folder. If you're using Colab, upload it to Google Drive or temporary storage, then change the path in the notebook to `data_dir= "/content/drive/MyDrive/Dataset/Obscenity"`.
- Run the notebook to train the model.

**Remember:**
- The purpose of this guide is to show you how to work with machine learning and datasets. It doesn't encourage or promote explicit content.
- Always follow ethical guidelines and respect content usage rights.
- Learning and creating models like this requires responsibility and respect for others' content.
